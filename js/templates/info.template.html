	<p>Hello, my name is Art Taylor. I am a recent graduate of the Minnesota School of Business, where I majored in Information Technology, with an emphasis in web development. I started getting interested in this field when I had to create a website for my Boy Scout troop as a requirement for my Eagle Scout, which I got a few years later. I continued on into high school taking every class I could on computers and web design, and felt so strongly about it that I decided to go to major in Web Design in college. I am continually browsing industry websites and blogs to keep up on the trends in the Web Design industry, and learning new subjects as they come along. For instance, my school does not offer any courses in HTML5, which is a very strong emerging language for the web that many employers are looking for, so I taught myself HTML5 and CSS3. I also noticed that many employers are looking for Front-end developers with experience in Photoshop, which I had limited exposure to, and again taught myself more about this product. I am very passionate about my field and anything I can do to better myself in it. You can reach me by phone at (612)-861-7372, ask for Art the 4th, or by email at Arttay1190@yahoo.com.</p>
